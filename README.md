# Hi, I'm Alex and I'm a data enthusiast!

I'm a data enthusiast who admires working with data's full journey so that it's captured, maintained, and presented in a way to gain the best actionable insights at any given moment. I enjoy having the opportunity learn something new with every project I encounter and develop new domain knowledge with whatever I may be working on. Personally, I think working with data is an extremely fulfilling experience since I get to use a combination of technical knowledge and a creative skillset to empower others with knowledge so that we can all be better off.

# Hi, I'm Alex and I'm a data enthusiast!

I love getting the chance to learn something new with every project I encounter. Not just mastery in this field, but about the content I get to explore, discover insights, and investigate ways to problem solve for.

I can’t think of any other field that let’s me wield not just technical skills like working with databases, analytic tools like Excel and Tableau, and Python to find practical insights on the information I’m working with, but also utilize creative programs from the Adobe Suite like Illustrator and Photoshop to create a cohesive design that is as practical as it is beautiful to solve real world problems. With experience over time, I hope to become increasingly proficient in graphic design and learn more advanced data science topics to build even more comprehensive projects.

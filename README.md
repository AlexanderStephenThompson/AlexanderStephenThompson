# Hi, I'm Alex and I'm a data enthusiast!

From database design and data entry, analytics with various tools, and even a bit of graphic design to really make a project “pop”, I love all aspects of data because I get the chance to learn something new with every project and get to help others along the way – a fantastic win-win. I’m quite familiar with Excel and Tableau to tackle projects, but I want to learn how to use Python and R to tackle more advanced topics and become proficient in Adobe programs to design reports and dashboards so that the findings are not just informative, but intuitive and exciting to explore.
